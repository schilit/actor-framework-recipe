//! # Generic Messages
//!
//! This module defines the generic message types used for communication between
//! the `ResourceClient` and `ResourceActor`.

use crate::entity::ActorEntity;
use crate::error::FrameworkError;
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

/// Type alias for the one-shot response channel used by actors.
pub type Response<T> = oneshot::Sender<Result<T, FrameworkError>>;

/// Internal message type sent to the actor to request operations.
///
/// # Resource-Oriented Architecture
/// This enum implements a **Resource-Oriented** design pattern where each actor manages a specific
/// type of resource (the [`ActorEntity`]). Instead of defining ad-hoc messages for every operation,
/// we standardize around a set of lifecycle operations that apply to almost any persistent resource.
///
/// # The CRUD Pattern
/// The variants of this enum map directly to standard **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
/// plus a custom `Action` variant for resource-specific logic that doesn't fit the CRUD model.
///
/// - **Create**: Lifecycle start. Uses [`ActorEntity::Create`] to initialize a new resource.
/// - **Get (Read)**: Retrieval. Fetches the current state of the resource by ID.
/// - **Update**: State mutation. Uses [`ActorEntity::Update`] to modify an existing resource.
/// - **Delete**: Lifecycle end. Removes the resource.
/// - **Action**: Extensibility. Executes a custom [`ActorEntity::Action`].
///
/// # Entity Interaction
/// This type is generic over `T: ActorEntity`. It uses the associated types defined in the [`ActorEntity`] trait
/// (like `Create`, `Update`, `Action`) to ensure type safety for every operation.
/// This guarantees that you can't send a "User Create" payload to a "Product" actor.
